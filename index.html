  <li>Cario talks about two different types of data in chapter 7 and chapter 8 of his book. The data he talks about in chapter<br>
      7 is data that is gathered from experiments and surveys. This data can be manipulated to show trends such as the mean and<br>
      median. In chapter 8, however, the data he describes is collected and shows trends over time.</li>
  <li> Kinds of Visualizations
      <ul>
        <li><b>Seasonal Subseries Plot-</b> a chart used to display the month-by-month variation of a given variable. This type<br>
              of visualization is useful because you can compare the monthly variations to the monthly and yearly averages. However,<br>
              this type of plot can be difficult to read if you have not seen this type of plot before.</li>
        <li><b>Logarithmic Scale-</b> a chart that can show the percentage increase or decrease per day of a given variable. These are<br>
              useful to show the rate of change of a variable each day relative to days before it. This type of visualization, however, <br>
              does not allow us to see the overall change for the given time frame of the variable.</li>
        <li><b>Connected Scatterplot-</b> a scatterplot that shows how each point of the data set is connected by a line. These plots are<br>
              help show how closely the data is reated to one another. There becomes a problem with this plot when there are turns and<br>
               swirls that can throw off the data.</li>

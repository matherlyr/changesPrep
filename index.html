  <li>Cario talks about two different types of data in chapter 7 and chapter 8 of his book. The data he talks about in chapter<br>
      7 is data that is gathered from experiments and surveys. This data can be manipulated to show trends such as the mean and<br>
      median. In chapter 8, however, the data he describes is collected and shows trends over time.</li>

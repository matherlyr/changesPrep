  <li>Cario talks about two different types of data in chapter 7 and chapter 8 of his book. The data he talks about in chapter<br>
      7 is data that is gathered from experiments and surveys. This data can be manipulated to show trends such as the mean and<br>
      median. In chapter 8, however, the data he describes is collected and shows trends over time.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Seasonal Subseries Plot-</b> a chart used to display the month-by-month variation of a given variable. This type<br>
              of visualization is useful because you can compare the monthly variations to the monthly and yearly averages.<br></li>
